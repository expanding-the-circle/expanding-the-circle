Our project, “Expanding the Circle” trains students to think broadly about Computer Science, primarily Web Development and Cybersecurity.  We adopt an apprentice model of ethics education where students learn about the ethics of computing through simulations -- what we call “modules.”  In our modules we draw from work in Philosophy.   We embed our modules into existing CS courses at Lewis & Clark College.  As CS students gain technical know-how, they will also receive training in ethical decision-making.   Our students are the next generation of computer engineers and our goal is to make education in ethics central to their education as engineers.

Most ethics education involves: i) Discussing examples and writing reflections, Or  ii) Learning codes of conduct and discussing cases when codes might be relevant.  These are useful approaches.  Our project goes further. We develop simulations where students make decisions and receive feedback regarding potential effects of those decisions. Learning codes of conduct and discussing examples is important, but they do not, alone, help one develop the skill of ethical decision-making. In our model, as in any apprentice system, students learn through repeated practice. No other approach we can find focuses on practice the way we do.

Through our modules we hope students become accustomed to thinking about the broader impact of engineering decisions.  We hope it becomes standard operating procedure for engineers to think about social impact and then reason through ethical questions from the very moment they conceive of a project.

Our modules situate a group of students in a real-world context, drawn from actual cases where engineers have faced ethical challenges.   Each student is placed in a different role (e.g. CEO, technician, customer, senator).  One student is asked to make a decision, the other students then respond.  All the students receive some options to help them think about their decision and response, but, in the end, the decision is their own to make.   As the process iterates, students become aware of how others may be effected or respond.   In effect, we simulate the complexity of real life situations.  They can also begin again, and try a different decision.  

Our modules will accustom students to thinking about ethical issues like the safety of the internet, fair access, privacy and power as they develop technical solutions to problems.  Our hope is that the next generation of tech leaders will have a well-developed capacity to think in a broader way, or expand their circle, when they make technological innovations.

Finally, we develop a training workshop for faculty.  We will offer our first pre-conference workshop at the SIGCSE Conference in February 2020. After that workshop we will launch a website (we will buy ExpandingTheCircle.org) containing training videos, handouts and online discussion.

Our unique collaboration between CS and Philosophy has already reached a total of 59 students in two CS courses (December 2018 and January 2019) through Professor Martinez’s guest lectures in Web Development and Cybersecurity. Preliminary feedback from students (see attached) suggests our modules raise questions and offer approaches students had never considered.

Our project is in 4 stages:

Stage 1(Spring/Fall 2019):  Professors Mache and Martinez transition from informal collaboration to formal partnership, helping deepen their knowledge of Computer Science and Philosophical Ethics.   They will share readings, teach each other and attend each other’s classes.   

Stage 2 (Summer/Fall 2019):  Develop ethics modules for CS 211 (Cybersecurity) and CS 293 (Web Development); Using student collaborators and piloting in Summer and Fall CS courses.

Stage 3 (Fall and Winter 2019-20):  Develop a workshop to train instructors how to use the modules; Launch the workshop at SIGCSE Conference in Feb 2020.    

Stage 4 (Winter and Summer 2020):  Launch  ExpandingTheCircle.org which will house materials for online training and discussion.

“Expanding the Circle” meets the goals of the Mozilla award.  It aims to design materials that offer practice in the skill of ethical decision-making for use in existing CS courses, focusing on internet health.  We include approaches from diverse philosophical traditions, giving students a wealth of tools for thinking about ethics in practical contexts.  We are faculty at a small liberal arts college (primarily an undergraduate institution), so the project is feasible.  We work closely with one another across disciplines.  The grant provides  time and support to complete each project stage.   

We are providing online resources, so our project is scalable. ExpandingTheCircle.org will be a valuable resource reaching many educators, students, employers and employees. 

Finally, because we incorporate significant philosophical content from diverse traditions of ethics, our project moves discussion about Ethics and Technology forward (movement building).
